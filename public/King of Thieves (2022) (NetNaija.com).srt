00:00:43,481 --> 00:00:44,961
Hello!

2
00:00:45,284 --> 00:00:46,577
Hello!

3
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:49,883
Do you know who this person is?

4
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:51,969
I don't.

5
00:00:52,714 --> 00:00:56,346
Would you like me to tell you a story?

6
00:00:56,612 --> 00:00:58,600
Yes, I'd like that very much.

7
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,768
Okay honey, let's go.

8
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:02,062
Just one minute, he's going to tell us a story.

9
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:07,067
This is a story of bravery,

10
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:08,735
vengeance

11
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,237
and justice.

12
00:01:12,527 --> 00:01:15,395
It began a long time ago,

13
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:19,153
in the prosperous kingdom of Ajeromi.

14
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:13,860
Have you seen yourselves?

15
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,740
After several warnings, you refused to listen!

16
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:24,746
Now you have to bear the consequences of your actions.

17
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:25,788
That's how it should be.

18
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,165
Is it not so?

19
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,124
It is so!

20
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,878
You have done the unthinkable

21
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,964
now you will pay for it.

22
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,592
Ajeromi is not responsible for your deaths!

23
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,469
It's not us.

24
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:42,430
Do you understand? Ajeromi is not responsible for your deaths!

25
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,725
It's your act of stealing that is getting you killed.

26
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:46,809
Is it not so?

27
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:47,810
It is so…

28
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,021
Just imagine what they stole…

29
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:53,107
look at it.

30
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:55,693
Ajipejo! (Snake charmer)

31
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:56,694
Yes!

32
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,656
Do your job.

33
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:11,876
(Incantations)

34
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,295
Come out!

35
00:04:14,987 --> 00:04:21,844
Ajeromi kingdom was known for her strict punishment
for offences committed against the land

36
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:29,227
And of them all, stealing was the most despicable,
even petty stealing.

37
00:04:29,297 --> 00:04:33,760
And the punishment for it, the gravest.

38
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:42,723
When our story begins, Ajeromi kingdom is
celebrating the coronation of a new king.

39
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:45,129
King Adegbite.

40
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:49,998
You are now King over everything.

41
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:52,458
We will take you to all of them,

42
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:56,796
where you will prostrate to them for the last time ever!

43
00:04:57,911 --> 00:05:04,887
To finish his coronation rights, the king must pay
homage to the existing factions in his kingdom.

44
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:07,488
The Ifa Diviners.

45
00:05:08,046 --> 00:05:09,616
The witches.

46
00:05:09,616 --> 00:05:13,104
Adegbite, the son of Tadenikaro,

47
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:15,648
Congratulations on the ascension of the throne.

48
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:18,276
Henceforth, you have become the king of witches.

49
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,697
You have become the King of sorcerers!

50
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,410
Adegbite, you have also become the king of all spirit mothers.

51
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:35,418
You have become king over all the deadly
wizards who kill without warning.

52
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:49,182
[Wizard chant]

53
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,933
Pay homage to the King!

54
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:55,188
All hail the King!

55
00:05:57,113 --> 00:06:00,109
The Sango Oracle

56
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:23,174
[Sango chants]

57
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:28,805
Where is my food? Where is my food?

58
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:55,540
The Spiritual Forces.

59
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,751
Now that the King has paid homage, let us do the same.

60
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:03,005
All hail the King!

61
00:07:03,221 --> 00:07:07,979
And the heavenly beings you
know as masquerades.

62
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,596
King Adegbite, may you reign long.

63
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:13,808
Amen

64
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,309
May rats cry like rats

65
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:17,311
Amen

66
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,980
May birds cry like birds

67
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,815
Amen

68
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:25,220
And may humans behave like humans

69
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:28,182
Amen....

70
00:07:54,959 --> 00:08:03,399
The King was king over all. Loved by everything
he watched over, and untouched by none.

71
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,423
That’s enough.

72
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:30,426
Hail the King

73
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:35,765
My King.

74
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:37,934
King Adegbite,

75
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:40,811
Son of Tadenikaro,

76
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,564
the Prince who has now become the King!

77
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:44,941
May your reign be long

78
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,026
Amen

79
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:52,031
May you live long

80
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,492
Amen

81
00:08:54,659 --> 00:09:01,040
I greet everyone of you here today, may we experience peace always.

82
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,459
Amen

83
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:05,002
May we will leave wealth for our children.

84
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:06,796
Amen

85
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,005
Isn’t it a glorious one for us?

86
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:09,840
It is!

87
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,010
My King will address you all...

88
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:16,222
My King.

89
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:25,106
All Hail the King

90
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:31,821
High Chief, may you live long.

91
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,990
Amen

92
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,868
May you all prosper in all you do

93
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:39,579
Amen

94
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,871
Villagers!

96
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,667

(Cheering)

98
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,005
I greet you all!

99

We greet you too!

100
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,384
This celebration is for all of us!

101
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:54,969
Yes

102
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:57,930
I greet all the chiefs

103
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:58,681
(Cheering)

104
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:04,228
I greet all the Royal Fathers seated, thank you for rejoicing with me!

105
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,355
May we have more of such happy celebration.

106
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:07,773
Amen

107
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:15,031
While I was in seclusion, I heard everything going on out here.

108
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:21,287
In particular, I heard about the activities of the Royal families…

109
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:23,873
(Hailing the King)

110
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:28,961
thank you all for standing by me.

111
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:35,301
There was a song I was told you sang while I was in seclusion.

112
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:37,261
Please, can you sing the song for me now?

113
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,724
They are always ready.

114
00:10:41,724 --> 00:11:04,538
(Women singing and dancing)
We got the crown, above all others.

115
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:07,083
That is fine, thank you so much.

116
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:13,255
Today is not the day for much banter, let’s keep rejoicing and dancing.

117
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:14,882
Amen..

118
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:16,884
And we will continue to rejoice.

119
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,344
Amen..

120
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,637
Where are the King’s masquerades?

121
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:20,698
{Fire cracking}

122
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,046
Potash is a very rare kind of stone.

123
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:37,006
Oh yes

124
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,507
Salt is a very different kind of sand

125
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:39,467
You are right!

126
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:45,347
I have witnessed many coronations

127
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:47,683
but Adegbite's is different.

128
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:50,060
Why won't it be so?

129
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:58,778
I have witnessed more of such in the past,

130
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:02,323
Is it because he gave us horses and gifts?

131
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:06,660
This might be because you’re closer to his village.

132
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:11,916
But to be honest, these are a lot of gifts.

133
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,684
Only a greedy person will say
this is not a lot of gifts.

134
00:13:13,684 --> 00:13:17,296
But Ajeromi Kingdom had a brewing crisis.

135
00:13:17,651 --> 00:13:20,966
A group of bandits terrorized the land,

136
00:13:21,326 --> 00:13:27,598
plundered the reserves, and carted away
valuables, and people into slavery.

137
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:34,257
This band of robbers was led by a
powerful man named Agesinkole.

138
00:13:34,391 --> 00:13:37,293
Can't you see we are royalty?

139
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:41,570
Kneel down!

140
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:50,120
[Agesinkole group slang]

141
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,042
Seize the royal beads on their necks.

142
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,336
Sit there!

143
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:01,173
Take their slaves and properties to my palace.

[Kings whimpering]

145
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,304
Quiet! My Lord wants to speak!

146
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:12,434
I have no desires to kill anyone today,
but I want to send a warning message.

147
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,229
You, leave that place!

148
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,693
[Kings crying.]

149
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,069
Take everything to my palace!

00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:34,164
Move! Move!!

Move! Move!!

153
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:43,841
Why are you silent? Who is the person?

154
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,510
Erm... My King,

155
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,346
no one really know who he is!

156
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:53,475
They claimed he suddenly appeared to them in the bush.

157
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:58,022
In fact, this person assaulted one of the Kings!

158
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:03,944
I ask again, who is this notorious and audacious person!

159
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:04,945
Who?

160
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,156
M.. My King.

161
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,450
They call him Agesinkole!

162
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,412
They call him Agesinkole!

163
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:15,664
Agesinkole?

164
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:16,916
I am the one.

165
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:22,379
I am the untouchable one

166
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:25,633
I am invincible and as slippery as an eel

167
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,594
Do not underestimate my power.

168
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:33,641
I cannot be captured by your petty armaments

169
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,520
Look here this man, this is bigger than you!

170
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:39,980
You are sick!

171
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:42,191
May you and your ancestors not prosper!

172
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,526
How dare you brag before me, Adegbite!

173
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:49,156
Adegbite who hates empty words.
Who defeated rebels and evil ones.

174
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:53,077
I, the son of Tadenikaro who never runs from any fight.

175
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:56,664
I am always ready for war

176
00:15:56,664 --> 00:16:00,960
Because my Father’s spirit leads me everytime

177
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,545
I need you to answer my questions!

178
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:08,676
Why did you ambush and steal from the Kings who came for my coronation?

179
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,262
This is just the beginning. In fact, I am yet to start,

180
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:15,015
I just showed you a little and Ajeromi is afraid.

181
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:19,228
If I throw the staff in my hand, it will destroy everyone dear to you.

182
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:24,900
You are just bluffing! You cannot do a thing!

183
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:28,237
No amount of saliva can ever make an ocean

184
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:37,079
I command you and your evil tricks to perish with you

185

The gods of the world, my ancesstors, take him!

186
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,759
Abomination!

187
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:09,695
I will not die.

188
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,905
And sickness will not befall me.

189
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:14,575
May today's death not be my portion.

190
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,495
May sickness of the day not be my portion.

191
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,460
This dream has a lot meanings.

192
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:20,159
The queen's unusual sleeping position
greatly troubled the king,

193
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,516
and it was a source for concern.

194
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:27,499
My King, I have told you to stop asking that question…

195
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:33,380
I already told you that some matters are for specific periods.

196
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:38,302
Go and see your Chiefs and do what you need to do for your people.

197
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:42,514
We will talk about our personal issues when the time is right.

198
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:51,732
I have heard you, but I

199
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:57,487
My King, when there are multiple problems, we handle the important ones first.

200
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:02,326
The issue facing the village right now is more important than
the issue between us.

201
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:06,622
My King, go attend to the chiefs.

202
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,333
Is that what you want it?

203
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,292
Yes.

204
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:14,588
Okay. No Problem.

205
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:26,516
My King…

206
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,644
{Cock crows}

207
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:44,868
Hello.

208
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:55,587
[Hunter chanting]

209
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,339
Ha, Alari

210
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:10,143
Rise, rise… It's been a while.

211
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:11,395
How are your children?

212
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:13,272
We are all well, thank you.

213
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:18,026
Hmm... Alari,

214
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:23,532
this burden for two that has become all yours, may it be easy for you.

215
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,658
Amen

216
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,618
God will support you.

217
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:32,874
Alari, It is true what they say that
when the head of a house dies,

218
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,168
the house may become chaotic.

219
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:39,089
If the mother dies, the children may disorderly.

220
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:44,177
But whoever has the support of the almighty, is covered.

221
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:45,804
May he help you carry your burden

222
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:46,763
Amen

223
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:52,060
Unfortunately, today isn’t a good day in the forest,

224
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:53,603
but let’s do this…

225
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,863
This is what ogun provided today, you can have it and make some delicacy.

226
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,448
Really! Thank you so much

227
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:07,492
Hello.
May the god of iron be with you.

228
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:10,662
Thank you so much, may you become more successful.

229
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:11,788
Amen

230
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:12,748
Thank you so much.

231
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,189
Mother.

232
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:43,653
Ha, this is Alari!

233
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:47,366
It is certain I will be fortunate today!

234
00:22:47,484 --> 00:22:50,160
Oh, mother!

235
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:54,414
It's being a while

236
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:58,251
Yes mother, I went on a short journey

237
00:22:58,251 --> 00:22:59,378
Really?

238
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:01,963
I came back two nights ago.

239
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,342
How are the children?

240
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:08,261
They are with my mother on a holiday.

241
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:12,891
That is good, you can also seize the opportunity to rest

242
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:14,726
...true.

243
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:17,896
Please mother, when Oguntade returns,

244
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,065
thank him on my behalf,

245
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,526
he gave me a whole Guinea Fowl this morning

246
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:24,945
Really?

247
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:33,620
You should also thank the hunter's wife.

248
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,539
oh, I didn’t know...

249
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:36,706
save it

250
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:44,881
What is it?

251
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,342
Ariyibi.

252
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:53,515
Are you surprised by Ariyibi's actions?

253
00:23:56,852 --> 00:24:02,566
She has inherited bitterness from her people

254
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:06,987
Its fine. So, what can I help you with ma?

255
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:09,948
oh please, don’t bother.

256
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,370
Hello! Who is home?

257
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:21,877
Aríyíbí! Aríyíbí! I’m back

258
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:28,008
What is it? Why are you shouting my name?

259
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,509
Ariyibi.

260
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:34,306
Why are you always ready for a fight?

261
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,224
Have I offended you just now?

262
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:38,560
Why is your face like this?

263
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:41,104
My dear Ariyibi

264
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:46,526
[Praises Aríyíbí]

265
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:49,237
Why are you upset with me?

266
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:51,865
I would have really loved to continue praising you,

267
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:53,408
but right now, I am hungry.

268
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:56,578
I need you to arrange my food and some bath water

269
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,581
We have no food at home

270
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:04,836
We have no food at home?

271
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:07,255
What happened to the grass cutter soup you cooked yesterday?

272
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:08,507
I already washed it away.

273
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:11,009
You washed it away?

274
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:11,968
Yes

275
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:14,471
Was it tainted with a rat’s urine?

276
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:17,933
No, I just washed it away.

277
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:18,767
Ha!

278
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:23,897
Please, kindly show me the Elephant you brought home.

279
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,692
What Elephant?

280
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:34,282
No Elephant, yet you gave out a whole Guinea fowl?

281
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:35,909
Isn't that so?

282
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:41,831
For you to give such away, then you must have an elephant to bring home.

283
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,752
Àdùnní…

284
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:52,676
What has the guinea fowl I gave out got
to do with the soup you washed away?

285
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:58,431
The great philanthropist! When hunger tortures you, you will understand

286
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:00,308
continue to chat with the wall

287
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:02,185
Aríyíbí! Aríyíbí!

288
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:05,981
You want the god of Iron to...

289
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:08,775
I have made a terrible mistake marrying you

290
00:26:59,686 --> 00:27:03,288
While the king worried about his wife's predicament,

291
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:07,879
Agesinkole's reign of terror spread
further into Ajeromi kingdom.

292
00:27:07,879 --> 00:27:13,167
The kingdom was brought to it's knees,
and help was sought from far and wide,

293
00:27:13,416 --> 00:27:19,041
for a champion to defeat the
menace of this king of thieves.

294
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:19,199
While the king worried about his wife's predicament, Agesinkole's reign of terror spread further into Ajeromi kingdom.

295
00:27:19,199 --> 00:27:20,640
It will not be well with everyone of you.

296
00:27:37,678 --> 00:27:42,577
First the association of hunters led
by oguntade was summoned.

297
00:27:42,984 --> 00:27:47,412
The local hunters always have the
support of Ogun, the god of Iron.

298
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:52,170
Look, if you all gather and attack him, he will be dead!

299
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:55,924
What is the use of the sticks you all carry that you call guns

300
00:27:57,967 --> 00:28:03,223
Head Hunter? Is this why you brought us here? Can we go home?

301
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,475
- Which home are you talking about?
- Our homes

302
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:07,686
Which home?

303
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:13,608
We are talking about a notorious criminal here and you hunters can't seem to do anything about it.

304
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,653
Isn’t a hunter superior to a thief?

305
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,030
Look...

306
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:22,701
What are we looking at Chief? What is there to See?

307
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:27,372
We can't be hunters and not be bold enough to speak the truth.

308
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:29,332
Look...

309
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:39,092
I don’t mean to sound offensive but we are hunters not hired killers!

310
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:40,427
Oh Yes!

311
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,845
Hunters, am I correct?

312
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,596
Animals will die, human will live.

313
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,348
Did you hear them Chiefs?

314
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,976
They said animals will die, human will live!

315
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:48,935
Was that what they said?

316
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:50,854
Exactly what they said!

317
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:57,277
Listen well to me Chief, you have High
Chiefs in the Village who are warriors…

318
00:28:57,277 --> 00:29:03,408
the ones you have made Warrior.
Send them on this mission to kill for you.

319
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,285
It is the duty handed to them by their fathers.

320
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:05,952
Yes!

321
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:07,245
We are mere hunters!

322
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:11,958
If that doesn't work for you,

323
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:16,296
let the King lead and let all the Chiefs follow,

324
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:20,133
to go and kill this "mere thief".

325
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,092
Exactly!

326
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:25,180
Elders always say; “the depth of an elders knowledge…”

327
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,056
"is always hidden!"

328
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:28,349
How dare you say that?

329
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:29,476
Oguntade!

330
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:30,393
Yes Chief!

331
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:32,103
Don’t toy with our intelligence!

332
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:35,607
Are you trying to help or just mocking us?

333
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:40,028
Mock you? I dare not! Who am I to try such.

334
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:46,075
All I’m trying to say is we don’t want any troubles…

335
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:51,710
[Hunters singing]
We don't want trouble.

336
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:57,962
Then, the kingdom called out to Sango,
the god of Thunder and fire for help.

337
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:08,681
God of thunder and fire.

338
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:11,976
The palm and pawpaw trees bow to the wind.

339
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:15,772
When thunder strikes in the forest, all the inhabitants feel it.

340
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:18,983
Agesinkole has refused to honor you,

341
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:23,154
I hereby send death to him today! May he die a shameful death!

342
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:28,159
Sango!

343
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:44,259
Sango will never strike the house of a bata drummer

344
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:46,761
The blacksmith’s tweezer will never fail him

345
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:50,890
Neither a basket or a net can ever hold water

346
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:53,059
Sango...god of fire

347
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:55,436
Give me your power!

[Agesinkole group slang]

349
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:17,709
Sango the god of thunder,
you have not broken your covenant with me.

350
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,377
Death and sickness are not mates.

351
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:23,882
When death speaks, sickness is silent.

Boys...

353
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:31,097
Come and taste from the oil of Sango! It's very tasty!

354
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:34,017
Yes my Lord, we will all taste it.

355
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:37,937
well done everyone.

00:31:57,081 --> 00:32:03,338
(Abegunde hailing himself)

357
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,131
Listen to this fool!

358
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:06,257
I've played.

359
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:10,929
Look here Abegunde, I already told you,
Ladele is the only one you can bully!

360
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:11,971
Who?

361
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:13,932
You are the only one he can bully.
Me?

362
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:15,558
Okay then,

My Lord, I heard the sound of a gunshot just now.

548
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:42,044
I killed a squirrel damaging my farm

549
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,047
Did you kill it completely?

550
00:48:45,547 --> 00:48:47,215
No, I only shot the leg.

551
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:49,760
You should have killed it completely.

It’s not an injury.

571
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:44,750
Why would they go with him?

573
00:50:53,508 --> 00:51:00,807
Why would Abegunde make himself the
spokesperson for all the other masquerades!

Whatever has happened to him served him right!

575
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:11,735
That is to say, Abegunde has done more than he can handle.

576
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:15,489
The masquerades turned their backs on him.

577

That is to be expected, everyone knows you,
but you can only know a few.

I know you very well my King.

Your Kolanut spoke?

627
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:27,138
Yes it did.

628
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:31,893
It spoke about your wife Aríyíbí

Father is all well?

That is why I’m here,

631
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:43,321
I was told that we need to find a big deer,
and sacrifice it for your wife.

632
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:47,993
So this unhealthy jealousy does not
kill her, like it killed her mother.

Father, is it that serious?

634

Yes, very serious.

635
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:55,166
I was initially scared when I thought
about the possibility of finding a deer,

636
00:54:55,166 --> 00:54:58,586
but felt better when I remembered, her husband is a hunter.

637
00:54:58,586 --> 00:55:00,046

Let him do whatever pleases him.

I gave it to you.

719
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:43,056
Why then did you do this to me?

720
01:00:43,765 --> 01:00:46,726
Adefimihan!!!

721
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:48,227
Shut up your mouth.

722
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:51,648
What Adefimihan are you calling on?

723
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:54,025
Call him out and let’s see him!

724
01:00:55,109 --> 01:00:57,320
Call out Adefimihan and let's see him.

725
01:00:57,779 --> 01:01:01,658
You this shameless and stupid woman.

726
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:05,495
You have ruined my life.

727
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:14,295
You looked at me and destroyed the only
reason I was not called an infertile man

728
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:15,672
This woman...

729
01:01:16,881 --> 01:01:17,924
What did I tell you?

730
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:21,678
Didn't I warn you to make sure he doesn't go out?

731
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:23,304
Why did you let him go out?

732
01:01:23,304 --> 01:01:28,101
My king, my king, how was I supposed to know?

733
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:29,060
Know what?

734
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:33,189
Did I know that Agesinkole would
return back into this village?

735
01:01:33,731 --> 01:01:39,570
The village was calm and things had return to normal,

736
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:42,031
why would I need to keep hiding the Prince?

737
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:47,328
My king, remember that the Prince and
the commoner were born the same way…

738
01:01:47,328 --> 01:01:49,455
Don’t you dare finish that statement

739
01:01:50,581 --> 01:01:52,875
If you dare finish the statement you are in big trouble.

740
01:01:58,464 --> 01:02:01,634
You have pleased yourself, right?

741
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:03,386
My King

742
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:08,224
Adefimihan, you have punished me!

743
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:11,185
Adefimihan!!!

744
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:15,148
Mothers of the earth, I have suffered.

745
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:17,567
I have been stripped naked!

746
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:19,402
Adefimihan!!!

747
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:24,782
Adefimihan!!!

748
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:03,780
Wizards in the house, I hail you.

749
01:03:07,408 --> 01:03:09,076
Witches in the house, I greet you

750
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:17,126
I greet all the spirit beings.
Thank you.

751
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:19,796
I thank you all for killing my son.

752
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:23,925
Thank you for stripping me naked.

753
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:27,220
Thank you for making me a childless man!

754
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:31,849
Thank you for ruining my life.

755
01:03:34,101 --> 01:03:36,896
Haven't I done everything you asked?

756
01:03:36,896 --> 01:03:42,735
It turns out you are not reliable.
It turns out you are not to be trusted.

757
01:03:42,735 --> 01:03:45,571
I regret all the times I spent with you.

758
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:52,703
In fact, I curse the day I met you all.

759
01:03:53,996 --> 01:04:11,848
I am here to warn you, that the next time
you see me here, do whatever you want to me

760
01:04:12,765 --> 01:04:17,228
You worthless bunch

761
01:04:19,772 --> 01:04:20,815
What is it?

762
01:04:26,237 --> 01:04:27,321
Shameless beings.

763
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:32,076
My life was destroyed right under your noses,

764
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:35,663
or are you all here to take my life too?

765
01:04:36,622 --> 01:04:39,292
I ask again, what did you ask that I failed to give?

766
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:49,844
All you requested of me even when
they were inconvenient, I gave to you.

767
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:59,896
I worshiped and paid homage to you,
yet you have made my life unbearable.

768
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:04,400
If I had known how unreliable you were,

769
01:05:04,859 --> 01:05:07,403
would I have spent my life believing in you!

770
01:05:08,279 --> 01:05:13,034
I say it again, if you ever see me here again,
do with me whatever pleases you.

771
01:05:13,951 --> 01:05:15,369
Ingrates!

772
01:05:16,704 --> 01:05:17,997
Shame on you.

773
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:21,125
Shame!

774
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:26,255
Shame on you all.

775
01:05:55,326 --> 01:05:56,327
I sense something.

776
01:06:09,006 --> 01:06:12,093
Agesinkole, your end has come.

777
01:06:15,346 --> 01:06:22,186
That's impossible.

778
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:25,106
Keep quiet, before whom are you bragging?

779

[Incantations]

780
01:06:46,335 --> 01:06:50,756
We have come take away your clothes of
honor, I order you to strip yourself naked!

[Incantations]

782
01:07:03,227 --> 01:07:10,109
Agesinkole, may the winds blow you to heaven!

[Incantations]

784
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:50,357
You killed my men!

785
01:07:58,115 --> 01:08:01,911
Let all swords go back to their sheaths

786
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:06,207
Let all powers return to their sources

787
01:08:06,290 --> 01:08:07,333
Sit down!

788
01:08:08,375 --> 01:08:11,629
He says we should sit, let’s see what he plans to do.

789
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:26,977
I see that you witches came prepared.

790
01:08:28,312 --> 01:08:29,855
What have I even done to deserve that?

791
01:08:30,606 --> 01:08:39,198
My fathers, the wizards? Why did
you bring a gun to a fist fight?

792
01:08:39,615 --> 01:08:56,173
I know you all, even if you don't know me.

793
01:08:56,173 --> 01:08:57,675
You are surprised.

794
01:08:58,259 --> 01:09:02,930
I know the witches, the wizards and even the spirits!

795
01:09:03,514 --> 01:09:10,729
Look here, I won’t let you leave.
You will go with me to our destination.

796
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:14,733
[Agesinkole group chant]

797
01:09:16,485 --> 01:09:23,214
Oguntade, worried about losing his wife to the cold hands
of death, sought out the necessary sacrifice.

798
01:09:23,214 --> 01:09:26,996
-You found one?
-Ogun did it.

799
01:09:32,042 --> 01:09:32,585
Oguntade!

800
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:33,252
Yes father!

801
01:09:35,504 --> 01:09:38,716
May it we well for you, thank you.

802
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:39,341
So shall it be father.

803
01:09:39,592 --> 01:09:42,052
May you be greatly rewarded for this!

804
01:09:42,052 --> 01:09:42,678
So shall it be father.

805
01:09:43,721 --> 01:09:46,348
Father, I did it for myself

806
01:09:46,599 --> 01:09:49,268
You did it for both of us

807
01:09:49,268 --> 01:09:55,649
My only plea is that the gods accept our sacrifice

808
01:09:55,649 --> 01:09:56,775
They will, in fact, they have

809
01:09:56,775 --> 01:09:57,735
Amen

810
01:09:57,776 --> 01:10:01,197
We already have what they asked for, put your mind at rest.

811
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:04,700
Thank you father. Let me hurry home to freshen up

812
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:10,706
Its fine, you may go. Thank you so much.

813
01:10:10,706 --> 01:10:12,374
Let’s thank the Ogun.

814
01:10:24,178 --> 01:10:25,679
Wait right there.

815
01:10:28,766 --> 01:10:30,267
What is going on?

816
01:10:30,809 --> 01:10:33,062
What have I done and why are
your guns pointed at me?

817
01:10:33,062 --> 01:10:34,104
Seize his gun!

818
01:10:34,104 --> 01:10:35,481
Seize my gun?

819
01:10:35,856 --> 01:10:37,650
Ogunsakin what is going on?

820
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:40,402
We have nothing to say to you here,

821
01:10:40,527 --> 01:10:42,238
when we get to the palace, you will explain yourself.

822
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:44,365
May Ogun not let me have no reason
to explain anything at the palace.

823
01:10:44,615 --> 01:10:46,492
What do I have to explain? What did I do?

824
01:10:46,492 --> 01:10:49,453
You will explain your thieving act on Alonge's farm!

825
01:10:49,453 --> 01:10:50,871
Me! No way! May Ogun not let me steal!

826
01:10:50,871 --> 01:10:52,414
Me! No way! May Ogun not let me steal!

827
01:10:52,414 --> 01:10:56,502
Yes, it was you. I saw you clearly.

828
01:10:56,502 --> 01:11:00,673
Hello!

829
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:11,392
Ogun please help me

830
01:11:15,312 --> 01:11:17,147
Who is there!

831
01:11:31,078 --> 01:11:35,582
…if that is the case, let me…

832
01:11:36,208 --> 01:11:37,876
What do you have to say?

833
01:11:37,876 --> 01:11:43,132
Please don’t do this to me…
please, let’s settle this amicably.

834
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:51,974
Agesinkole has taken over the witches,
the wizards and the spirits.

835
01:11:52,433 --> 01:11:59,773
He fought and conquered them all.

836
01:12:00,190 --> 01:12:02,818
He is unstoppable at this point

837
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:04,820
I wasn’t even aware that the Queen is a witch.

838
01:12:05,112 --> 01:12:07,781
Will you shut your mouth!
Which Queen is a witch?

839
01:12:07,781 --> 01:12:08,991
Queen Bonuola.

840
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:10,451
Shut your mouth!

841
01:12:10,909 --> 01:12:13,996
If you’re not careful, I’ll ask the guards
to slice off your mouth with a knife.

842
01:12:16,290 --> 01:12:20,544
Wait, let’s exercise some patience.
Keep her calm and

843
01:12:20,544 --> 01:12:22,004
let her say whatever she has to say.

844
01:12:23,505 --> 01:12:24,923
Go on, I’m listening.

845
01:12:24,923 --> 01:12:28,260
May your mouth not be the end of you.

846
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:31,972
Still, what can we do at this point?

847
01:12:37,895 --> 01:12:38,854
My King

848
01:12:38,854 --> 01:12:39,855
My King

849
01:12:40,147 --> 01:12:43,025
Calm down. what’s going on? What’s his offense?

850
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:45,444
He stole and we want judgement!

851
01:12:50,491 --> 01:12:51,492
Mobonuola…

852
01:12:53,952 --> 01:12:54,953

01:13:01,001 --> 01:13:02,002
My King

854
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:11,678
My King

855
01:13:11,804 --> 01:13:15,140
Stop it, why are you calling him?
Can’t you see he’s in distress?

856
01:13:21,021 --> 01:13:21,688
I can see it.

857
01:13:21,855 --> 01:13:22,940
Can you see what I’m seeing?

858
01:13:23,774 --> 01:13:24,858
They said you have stolen from them.

859
01:13:29,863 --> 01:13:31,657
Even if we can’t attend to all cases,

860
01:13:31,990 --> 01:13:34,493
we will definitely make an exception for a thief like you.

861
01:13:35,035 --> 01:13:38,872
Hunters, take him to the Chief's court,

862
01:13:39,123 --> 01:13:40,624
we will judge his case there.

863
01:13:40,624 --> 01:13:42,684
Your running mouth will be attended to.

864
01:13:43,143 --> 01:13:43,669
I beg you, please, it was a mistake.

865
01:13:43,669 --> 01:13:48,645
With the proclamation, Oguntade
was already a dead man walking.

866
01:13:50,717 --> 01:14:08,277
Oh my, I'm in trouble. they sentenced
you to face the deadly criminal?

867
01:14:09,570 --> 01:14:16,577
The unstoppable bringer of death

868
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:19,163
That same Agesinkole?

869
01:14:19,371 --> 01:14:20,747
What about Agesinkole?

870
01:14:23,834 --> 01:14:26,420
Look at her, the cause of everything.

871
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:27,754
I don’t understand what's happening, mother.

872
01:14:27,754 --> 01:14:34,178
How would you understand? You won't
understand until you become a mother.

873
01:14:36,513 --> 01:14:37,347
Oguntade.

874
01:14:37,681 --> 01:14:38,682
Yes mother.

875
01:14:40,851 --> 01:14:46,773
I may not know much but this belly is filled with tricks

876
01:14:48,025 --> 01:14:55,073
Rather than mourn over my child, I would use the only option left for me.

877
01:14:55,073 --> 01:14:58,494
Oguntade, come with me.

878
01:14:58,619 --> 01:14:59,995
Leave my way.

879
01:14:59,995 --> 01:15:01,914
Come with me.

880
01:15:01,914 --> 01:15:07,794
For no one could defeat Agesinkole.
Not the witches, nor wizards.

881
01:15:07,794 --> 01:15:13,610
But, will a mother's love safe the
poor hunter from certain death?

882
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:15,474
So, Oguntade was buried alive for seven days.

883

[Chanting]
-Welcom my son.

885
01:17:22,137 --> 01:17:26,975
And on the seventh day, he was
recalled from the land of the dead.

886
01:17:26,975 --> 01:17:32,939
newly born, powerful and
ready for the dire task ahead.

887
01:17:43,950 --> 01:17:45,452
I can smell a human.

888
01:17:52,209 --> 01:17:54,169
A rat does not visit a bird's nest

889
01:17:56,088 --> 01:17:57,464
a bird does not visit a rat's hole.

890
01:18:39,673 --> 01:18:40,757
It is me.

891
01:18:40,757 --> 01:18:43,472
Death has come to visit you.

892
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:49,599
Today, is your last day on Earth.

893
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:55,188

the tale of Ogundabede, the King of Thieves.

If the prince does not still...

1022
01:29:28,529 --> 01:29:38,498
The Oracle further explains that the
Prince has to steal a fertile goat.

1023
01:29:39,207 --> 01:29:40,583
As his first act of stealing?

1024
01:29:40,583 --> 01:29:41,542
Yes.

1025
01:29:41,876 --> 01:29:46,589
You will not become the king if you won't
steal a goat. The Oracle has spoken.

1026

The road to greatness is filled with dirt,
you can’t reject the voice of the Oracle.

1032
01:30:04,482 --> 01:30:08,486
Meaning that the root of wealth is rotten!

1033
01:30:10,113 --> 01:30:13,157
Are you sure this is not a conspiracy?

1034
01:30:14,075 --> 01:30:16,327
If the Herbalist were to be from this village,

1035
01:30:16,702 --> 01:30:20,248
I would have thought the same but,
he is from a neighbouring village.

1036
01:30:21,332 --> 01:30:24,919
I also trust Chief Ọtun so well,
he will never deceive me.

1037

That is true, he is the only Chief
who genuinely loves us.

1038
01:30:32,510 --> 01:30:33,177
Right.

1039
01:30:33,177 --> 01:30:34,887
If Chief Ọtun loves us,

1040
01:30:35,054 --> 01:30:38,433
then all other Chiefs have no
choice but to do the same

1041
01:30:38,433 --> 01:30:39,392
Yes.

1042
01:30:40,309 --> 01:30:44,522
The way forward is to steal.

1043

You think I should steal?

1044
01:30:46,482 --> 01:30:58,744
Yes, if that’s the only way, you
can't go against destiny.

1045
01:30:59,412 --> 01:31:04,292
This could be your destiny and the
only way to ascend the throne.

Our soon-to-be King.

1047
01:31:14,260 --> 01:31:16,637
Have you forgotten that in three days,

1048
01:31:16,637 --> 01:31:19,056
the kingmakers will be at the
palace with the Ifa Oracle?

1049
01:31:19,056 --> 01:31:21,267
Where the final decision will be made
between you and the other prince.

1050
01:31:21,767 --> 01:31:28,191
Do you want to wait until you are ridiculed
by the Oracle to not become the king?

1051
01:31:29,317 --> 01:31:31,736
Chief Ọtun, I’m confused.

1052
01:31:33,279 --> 01:31:39,535
I have thought about it a great
deal and I am still confused.

1053
01:31:41,204 --> 01:31:43,789
…To steal a goat?

1054
01:31:44,916 --> 01:31:47,752
What if I’m caught?

1055
01:31:48,503 --> 01:31:52,381
In a town where we all know death
is the consequence of stealing.

1056
01:31:52,590 --> 01:31:55,259
since the days of our forefathers.

1057
01:31:55,801 --> 01:31:56,802
How will they know?

1058
01:31:57,136 --> 01:32:02,141
No one will know, they will only
know what we want them to know.

1059
01:32:02,934 --> 01:32:04,143
Really?

1060
01:32:04,143 --> 01:32:08,648
Chief, if I eventually take the goat…

1061
01:32:08,648 --> 01:32:11,817
-No, you won’t take it, you will steal it!

1062
01:32:12,485 --> 01:32:14,111
You have to steal,

1063
01:32:14,487 --> 01:32:16,697
that’s the idea, that is what the Oracle wants.

1064
01:32:17,532 --> 01:32:19,283
It's 'Ogundabede'.

1065
01:32:19,283 --> 01:32:24,914
If possible, talk to the goat. Let
it know you're about to steal it.

1066
01:32:25,748 --> 01:32:29,001
Don't you know that goats can hear us?

1067
01:32:29,585 --> 01:32:30,545
Goats can hear us.

1068
01:32:31,546 --> 01:32:32,505
You have to steal.

1069
01:32:32,505 --> 01:32:34,423
I will steal.

1070
01:32:34,924 --> 01:32:36,509
It is important to steal…

1071
01:32:36,509 --> 01:32:37,468
I will.

1072
01:32:55,200 --> 01:33:01,909
The poor prince did as was told by the corrupt
chiefs and a great horror befell him.

1073
01:33:07,164 --> 01:33:10,334
Well done, the shots scared me.

1074
01:33:10,710 --> 01:33:11,836
We didn’t shoot to scare you,

1075
01:33:11,836 --> 01:33:13,004
we are messengers from the palace.

1076
01:33:14,088 --> 01:33:19,552
How? See, the Chiefs are aware of this errand.

1077
01:33:19,552 --> 01:33:22,430
What chiefs? Open your bag.

1078
01:33:23,347 --> 01:33:27,935
The chiefs know about it

1079
01:33:29,562 --> 01:33:31,522
Take the bag from him and check!

1080
01:33:31,522 --> 01:33:33,107
The chiefs are aware,

1081

The chiefs they know about this…
I’m dead, they are aware!

1082
01:33:43,409 --> 01:33:45,578
What! This goat belongs to Ayoka's mother.

1083
01:33:45,745 --> 01:33:46,746
Pick it up!

1084
01:33:46,746 --> 01:33:49,165
Like I said before, the Chiefs…

1085
01:33:49,165 --> 01:33:55,504
Carry the goat or I shoot you.

1086
01:33:55,504 --> 01:33:57,381
Please don’t shoot me.

1087
01:33:58,924 --> 01:34:02,470
Put it around your neck!

1088
01:34:03,095 --> 01:34:07,433
Now, like I was saying, the Chiefs know about this.

1089
01:34:07,516 --> 01:34:09,602
Please don’t shoot me.

1090
01:34:10,061 --> 01:34:12,188
This is beyond us,

1091
01:34:12,188 --> 01:34:15,107
our hands are completely tied.

1092
01:34:16,067 --> 01:34:18,611
For as much as we want you to live amongst us forever,

1093
01:34:18,611 --> 01:34:21,113
your actions and deeds will not allow it.

1094
01:34:24,158 --> 01:34:27,370
Oh dear, this is really tragic.

1095
01:34:27,370 --> 01:34:31,248
Iyalode, this is beyond sympathy.

1097
01:34:33,376 --> 01:34:36,420
We cannot neglect our culture and tradition,

1098
01:34:36,420 --> 01:34:41,175
whoever does the unthinkable must face the consequence.

1099
01:34:41,175 --> 01:34:48,432
Look, this isn't personal,
but we can't be nonchalant

1100
01:34:49,141 --> 01:34:54,605
If we let you, you will sell this entire village and destroy it.

The Snake killer!

1102
01:34:57,066 --> 01:34:58,025

evil one, come for your meal.

Come forth!

1107

That is your meal…

My friend.

1110
01:35:57,710 --> 01:36:04,341
My friend Adeoye, what a pity.

1111
01:36:04,508 --> 01:36:09,638
Truth is dead, only deceit now lives.

1112

Adeoye! Adeoye!

1113
01:36:14,518 --> 01:36:21,692
Adeoye please wake up,

1114
01:36:21,942 --> 01:36:29,450
Adeoye, you know people will ask me about you.
What do you want me to tell them?

1115
01:36:30,075 --> 01:36:35,039
What do I tell them when they ask, please wake up.

What a pity… I will do my duty to you as a friend,

1121

I will give you a proper burial.

1122

You were stealing together?

No we weren’t

01:38:23,522 --> 01:38:25,774
You came to take his head! Take him away!

I did not just decide to revenge.

But every time I journey through the path where
your forefathers buried me,

1154
01:40:17,469 --> 01:40:19,346
It fuels my anger afresh.

I have waited for the son of Tadenikaro to become
king, so I can punnish him for his father's sin.

It's more than stealing mere yams.
